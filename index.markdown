Welcome to my (i.e. Jeremiah Faith) personal website. Here you can find out what I'm up to, where I've been, and links to other websites I develop.

I'm currently a Professor in the Marc and Jennifer Lipschultz Precision Immunology Institute and the Icahn Genomics Institute in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. If life were defined solely on the sequence of places one called home, the following would be my life:

West Palm Beach, FL &rarr;  St. Louis, MO &rarr;  Baldwin, MI &rarr;  St. Louis, MO &rarr;  Gadsden, AL &rarr; 
    Baton Rouge, LA &rarr;  Swansea, Wales &rarr;  Baton Rouge, LA &rarr;  Long Island, NY &rarr;  Boston, MA &rarr; 
    St. Louis, MO &rarr;  New York, NY.

If you're an old friend from high school or college (in which case you might know me as Buddy Faith) or other part of my life that found this site, why don't you send me a line. I'd be happy to learn where you are in the world and what you're doing.
