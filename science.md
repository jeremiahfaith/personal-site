I lead a research laboratory at the academic medical center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Our laboratory focuses on modeling the interactions between gut microbes and host physiology with an emphasis on Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Ongoing research in the lab includes: 1) understanding the influence of gut microbiota strain variation on human disease risk, 2) identifying microbial strains that modulate host phenotypic variation, 3) the stability of the human gut microbiota, and 4) microbiome-based therapeutics. 

In the present translational research of our lab, we are focused on determining if live microbes can be used to treat or prevent human disease. In the basic science discovery aspects of our lab, we explore properties of the strain level structure and stability of the gut microbiome. We also explore the antigen-specific T and B cell responses to the gut microbiota.

For more information on our science, look at our laboratory's website: [Faith lab](http://faithlab.mssm.edu/)

I'm also active in consulting, collaborating, and sitting on advisory boards with biotech companies to help bring drugs to the market. I have worked with Vedanta Biosciences, Janssen, Seed, Biomx, Janssen, Genfit, and Innovation Pharmaceuticals.
