My original plan in life was to be a musician. I enrolled at LSU as a music education major, and I am still interested in music teaching. I ultimately decided on a career in science but kept playing until my two sons were born. Then I paused my own playing and spent several years watching them learn to play (oldest son = cello + tenor sax; youngest son = piano + trombone). By 2022, my sons were set up well enough to practice on their own, and I started playing again. 

I'm working on a series of brass instruction books called *One Brass Embouchure Method* that I hope to finish one day and have instructional videos as a companion to the books. 

Our family makes a music video each year since 2022 on our YouTube channel [the oddly-shaped uh ohs](https://www.youtube.com/@theoddly-shapeduhohs674).  Here is an example from 2025:

Instruments I play the most: trombone, trumpet, string bass, voice (learning), piano (just for chord progressions)

Other instruments I have played in past ensembles: guitar, bassoon, euphonium, violin, drum set
